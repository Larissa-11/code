- Matlab FAC scripts (UVX/Sirius)
    . magnet_modelling
    . lattice_errors
    . insertion_devices
    . epu lib (radia-subset-like matlab implementation)
    . non_linear_beam_stay_clear
    . etc...
- collective_effects matlab scripts (UVX/Sirius)
- tracySirius (based on Soleil's Tracy3)
- trackc++ (tracking code based on AT/Tracy passmethods + mp_task_mgr)
