LNLS version of MML/AT, Matlab Scripts, Python and C/C++ codes

This is a collection of Matlab, Python and C/C++ codes written by the Accelerator Physics staff at LNLS for
the existing UVX storage ring and future 3rd generation Sirius light source.

Main projects in this repository:

- trackc++ (tracking code based on AT/Tracy passmethods + mp_task_mgr + differential algebra)
- trackcpp (a swig package port of trackc++ to python)
- pyaccel (python package port of matlab AcceleratorToolbox)
- fieldmaptrack (python scripts for analyzing fieldmaps from 3D magnet models)
- job_manager (python client-server scripts for running batch queues in a network grid of linux computers)
- mathphys (python package mathematical and physical constants and functions)
- lnls (python package with various lnls-specific parameters: folder paths, constants, etc)
- sirius_wiki (update parameters in wiki)
- MatlabMiddleLayer (for UVX/Sirius)
- Matlab FAC scripts (UVX/Sirius)
    . magnet_modelling
    . lattice_errors
    . insertion_devices
    . epu lib (radia-subset-like matlab implementation)
    . non_linear_beam_stay_clear
    . collective_effects matlab scripts (UVX/Sirius)
    . etc
