LNLS version of MML/AT, Matlab Scripts, Python and C/C++ codes

This is a collection of Matlab, Python and C/C++ codes written by the Accelerator Physics staff at LNLS for
the existing UVX storage ring and future 3rd generation Sirius light source.

Main projects in this repository:

- MatlabMiddleLayer (for UVX/Sirius)
- Matlab FAC scripts (UVX/Sirius)
    . magnet_modelling
    . lattice_errors
    . insertion_devices
    . epu lib (radia-subset-like matlab implementation)
    . non_linear_beam_stay_clear
    . etc...
- collective_effects matlab scripts (UVX/Sirius)
- fieldmap
- job_manager
- mathphys (mathematical and physical constants and functions)
- pyring (python port of matlab AcceleratorToolbox + MML)
- sirius_wiki (update parameters in wiki)
- trackc++ (tracking code based on AT/Tracy passmethods + mp_task_mgr)
- tracy_sirius (based on Soleil's Tracy3)
